This is a web scraper and analysis on the top 1000 movies on IMDB. 

To run, download both MovieDB.py and 'Movie Dashboard.xlsx'

on the command line type 'python moviedb.py'. This process should take a few minutes due to the timer implemented to avoid complications with the IMDB website.

Once ran a file called 'moviesDB.csv' should have been created. 

You can now open the Movie Dashboard Excel file as it references the CSV.
